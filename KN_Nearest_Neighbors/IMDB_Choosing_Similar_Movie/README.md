In this project, the goal is to gather data from the IMDB movie database and use K Nearest Neighbors to help make a choice on which movie to watch. 
The idea is that, if at some night we are feeling like watching something similar to 'Titanic', the program will give us 5 movies closest
to relation to it.

Another addition that will be made is to, given a movie you think you want to watch, ask the program to determine if its likely a good movie or not based 
on the rating of movies similar to it. Returning 1 if probably good, and 0 otherwise.
