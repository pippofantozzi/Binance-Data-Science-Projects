# Binance-Data-Science-Projects

From today, Nov 12 2022, I will be creating a new original Data Science/Machine Learning Project every day until the day of my interview at Binance
and beyond. I plan on doing a project on a new ML concept each day. Meaning, if I do decision trees today, I will do natural language processing tomorrow,
and Deep Learning after tomorrow, and so on. 

Ill try to vary it by not only ML concepts but topics as well. From more professional to more personal. Today I might try to find which movies are most similar to Shutter Island by using K Nearest Neighbors and an IMDB database so I can pick movies more easily with my girlfriend. Tomorrow I might use Convolutional Neural Networks to detect which Patient X Rays have a sign of cancer or not.

Looking forward to it ;)
