# Binance-Data-Science-Projects

From today, Nov 12 2022, I will be creating a new original Data Science/Machine Learning Project every day until the day of my interview at Binance
and beyond. I plan on doing a project on a new ML concept each day. Meaning, if I do decision trees today, I will do natural language processing tomorrow,
and Deep Learning after tomorrow, and so on.
